## Milestone 1

Members: Joey Pelletier, Alyssa Cady

Our project is called Limit Break. This will be a web app that can help out college students and young adults with facing substantial challenges/fears. The inspiration of this project comes from trying to overcome social anxiety and observations of flaws in existing apps (for example, some apps are scammy and want people to stay in the platform for more $$$, rather than actually solving their problems). This app's intention is to be a quick problem-solver rather than a money-hole platform.

This image is the mood board for Limit Break's design. This contains the main menu and certain UI elements used in the app.

For resources, this website shows tips on facing fears (https://www.verywellmind.com/healthy-ways-to-face-your-fears-4165487), and this one demonstrates common thinking errors(https://www.holisticwellnesspractice.com/2021/12/26/17-common-thinking-errors-how-to-identify-and-replace-them).

In terms of my personal contributions, I will assist with the design of a Figma mockup, along with deciding what the final design elements will be for the app. I will either work on coding up the fear tree or the small fears and their customizable features.

In terms of goals,

Initial Prototype: Figma mockup and basic code-up (no css) of MVP app

MVP: Stylized app with functionalities surrounded by red border in the user flow (i.e. user can create big fear and its small fears, and add a description to the smaller fears, plus checkmarks for if they conquered the fear).

Stretch goals: Add other items from user flow, like the confidence numbers and a resources tab for example.

## Milestone 2

### Joey's Process

For steps 1, 3, and 4, of 'Thinking in React', we figured out a UI scheme with the planned actions of state. Essentially, our goal was to figure out how to implement the note-taking part of the app. The drawing is shown below:

After we figured that out, we decided to practice React (mainly learning how to do the note-taking app) by ourselves. After my practice, I developed a web app that has the basic parts and design of my intended prototype, albeit the complexity is skimmed down. The user can type in their fear in a text box, and then it will show up on a "fear tree" after clicking the button.

Moving forward with the process, we are planning to compare designs and practice on 12/5. That way, we can demonstrate what we learned, and continue to iterate through the design process and achieve a full-functioning MVP.

## Milestone 4: Reflection

### Joey's Reflection

After going through the process of working on a group React project, it was definitely a new challenge for me. That was the first time I've ever coded with a group, and I realized how hard it is to connect multiple people's coding ideas together. I believe my teammate's code was well put-together and efficiently commented, it's just I need to practice more on reading and understanding other people's code. I'll be completely honest, I was not finishing this semester as strong as I thought I would. I could've done more on my parts, so I take accountability for that.

Nevertheless, we managed to create a stylized, full-functioning MVP (without the description part, though). My teammate did a very good job with the styling of the app, and I'll keep this design in mind when coming up with different designs for my capstone project. The big challenge was definitely applying React skills to a group project, and collabrating together with our codes. I'm also not the best at React right now, so this was a good learning experience that shows where I'm at with my knowledge. I now have a better idea on how to hide/display different components and how to display user input onto the app.
